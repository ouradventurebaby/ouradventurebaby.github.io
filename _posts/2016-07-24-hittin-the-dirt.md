After purchasing the RV our life got pretty hectic.

I ended up having to serve on jury duty for 8 days on a medical malpractice case. While the 
trial was interesting to observe, the deliberation with 11 other people was terrible and I felt 
very overwhelmed about having to be one of the decision makers. Luckily we were able to give our 
best verdict and awarded damages Friday before the 4th of July.

Unfortunately the trial was during my last two weeks at work, however I was able to work the 
last two days and have a going away lunch with my boss. I am really going to miss her.  If you need 
a divorce attorney, I highly recommend her, [Alexandra Geczi](http://www.familylawdfw.com "Alexandra Geczi").

On the 12th of July my niece Lena Lynn was born. I got to spend two days watching my nephew 
while my sister Robin had the baby and recovered in the hospital. It was a wonderful bonding 
moment for me and Alec. My mom drove up from New Braunfels just in time to be there for 
delivery and Eric (the daddy) made it in time as well.  It was a very sad time as well since we 
all knew that soon I would be leaving on my adventure, however we will still be in the area 
often in beautiful outdoor locations and are eager to have family visitors and take trips together.
