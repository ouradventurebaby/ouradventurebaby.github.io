In true Brandy fashion, I procrastinated starting this blog.  I guess I was never really sure until now that our adventure was going to happen.  I want to give some back story but I think that will have to have to be another post at another time.

Today after months of talking, shopping and looking at motorhomes we finally put an offer in on one.   We walked into the dealership this morning intending to make an offer on another model and wound up changing our minds when we saw this beauty.  The main difference is that it is a diesel pusher motorhome.  We hope to find out soon whether they accept our offer, then the rest of the process will begin like doing an overall check on the entire vehicle to make sure certain items work and do any repairs that might need to be done.

2001 Newmar Dutch Star

It is 38 feet long with a single living room and kitchen area slide out. The top will probably be need to be resealed.  The paint it still in decent shape and I think the mural is charming. We have joked about adding photos of ourselves to the mural, Clay riding the eagle and I will be swimming in the pond.  The awning above the slide will also need to be replaced.

Here is the front door. -->
